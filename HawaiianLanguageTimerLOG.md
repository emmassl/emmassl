ʻOlelo Hawaiʻi Timer

# Estimate of time to complete assignment
4 hours

# Actual time to complete assignment
| Date  | Time Started | Time Spent | Work completed |
| :---: | -----------: | ---------: | :------------- |
| 8/4 |       10:30pm |       1:30 | Began simple timer implementation (with time.sleep operating in-terminal), then moved onto complexer current timer displayed in Hawaiian (this project) along with using the Tkinter python GUI interface. Experienced trouble with screen not allowing for timer input, decided to refresh VScode along with the file etc and it resolved |
| 8/5 |       9:15am |       1:30 | Wanted to add more content, like date to timer. Also noticed the Reset button would not properly reset the timer (it only deleted the timer for a second displaying 00:00 to then switch back to the countdown (fixed by adding a global bool variable to verify if countdown should be active or not)). |
| 8/5 |       2:30pm |       1:00 | Refined colors, layout etc. Worked on getting a dictionary for the Hawaiian numbers for the timer. Still to be continued |
|       |              |     4:00 | total time spent       |

# Discussion
 Using Tkinter was the most suitable format for my purposes as a quick timer, as well as an opprotunity to learn more about Python GUIs.
